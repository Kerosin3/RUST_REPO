# OOP lesson
## Covered patterns:
1. Visitor
2. Decorator
3. Observer(Callback)

### Examples
1. `` cargo run --package decorator_v2_pattern `` to run decorator example
2. `` cargo run --package observer_pattern `` to run observer example
3. `` cargo run --package visitor_pattern `` to run visitor example

## Notes
1. Decorator: decorate run speed based on carrying weight and character mood. (dynamic dispatch)
2. Observer: callback when hash of new data differs from an old one. (static dispatch)
3. Visitor: auto dispatching specific objects methods transparently to visitor. (static dispatch)
